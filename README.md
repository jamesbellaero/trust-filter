# Cislunar Prop
## Purpose
Cislunar Prop is meant to propagate satellites in orbits which follow the Center Restricted 3-body Problem or orbits in cislunar space.

## Contents
Nothing yet. Ideally it will contain code to download ephemeris for lunar position, code for determining lunar position and frame over time, conversions between the CRTBP rotating reference frame, ECEF, ECI, and Lunar-centered Lunar Fixed/Rotating frames.

Inputs to primary propagation algorithms will be states in relevant frames and start/end times. Outputs will be time histories. Propagation will be performed with RK45 unless it's shown to be insufficient.

## Use
Well, it's matlab, so either download octave or use matlab. There shouldn't be any library requirement.
